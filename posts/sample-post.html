        <h1>AndreOS v0.7: My OpenClaw Multi-Agent System</h1>
        <p class="meta">Published: Feb 2026</p>

        <p>
          Over the last phase, I moved from “playing with bots” to building a practical multi-agent operating layer
          for life, business, and automation. The core idea was simple: explicit roles, durable memory, and routines
          that run without constant babysitting.
        </p>

        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>
          I replaced ad-hoc setup with a clean multi-agent model on one gateway. Each agent has clear responsibilities
          (personal ops, business front-desk behavior, technical automation), with emphasis on predictability over improvisation.
        </p>

        <h2>Automation That Runs</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Flight monitoring with cron, robust timeout handling, and recovery logic.</li>
          <li>Timeline digest pipeline (pull → summarize → digest), including rate-limit lessons.</li>
          <li>Scheduled checks and reminders through heartbeat/cron patterns.</li>
          <li>Message triage and task organization workflows.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Personal Ops Layer</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Photo-based nutrition tracking with conservative macro estimates and correction loops.</li>
          <li>Scale-photo weight tracking with append-only logs.</li>
          <li>Daily execution system using checklist discipline.</li>
          <li>Chess analysis with Chess.com + Stockfish (CPL, blunders, mistakes, inaccuracies).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Business Ops Layer</h2>
        <p>
          I applied the same principles to local business operations: front-desk intake behavior, lead qualification,
          messaging/voice integration, and explicit guardrails to avoid chaotic assistant behavior.
        </p>

        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Context evaporates unless persisted.</li>
          <li>Long jobs without explicit timeout discipline become failure-prone.</li>
          <li>Role-based multi-agent systems beat profile sprawl.</li>
          <li>Reliability and behavior contracts matter more than clever outputs.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This is my current <strong>AndreOS v0.7</strong>: not random chatbot experiments, but a structured operating stack
          with roles, memory, and routines. Next step is shaping v1.0 with lower friction and stronger autonomy.
